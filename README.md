<h1>The Simple Introduction</h1>
<p><i>Developed By <b>Mahmoud Osman</b></i></p>
<h2>What is Neuranux</h2>
<p>In Simple Words, Neuranux is a Nervous System Implementation Using <b>C/C++</b> For <b>Linux</b> System Level Programmers, Which Simply Focuses On Simplifying Electrical Signals And Motions, With a Built-in Simple Text Processing Model That Processes English Instructions Into Digital Nervous Messages</p>
<p>Plus, You Can Integrate Neuranux With Other Frameworks Or Models, Neuranux Contains Built-in Functions To Directly Send Signals To Nerves</p>
<p>Flexible, Dynamic, Wireless Support, Which Means It's Not Limited For Robotics Or Motions Only, It's Extended For All Linux System Level Programmers, Organs Can Be Accessed Wirelessly Through TCP Nerves</p>
<p>The Brain is Only Supported To Compile For Linux Machines, Because The Linux OS is Way More Better, Faster, And More Secure Than Any Other OS There</p>
<p>Organs And Suborgans Are A Cross-Platform C Code Which Means Can Be Compiled For Various Microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Espressif Boards And So On...</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><So This Framework is A Neural System Implementation, So You Can Have A Centralized Device Which is the Brain, A Linux Machine Running The Brain, That Sends Signals To Organs And Suborgans Which Are Any Microprocessor, ESPs, Arduinos, Raspberry Pies..., Signals Are Send Through TCP Protocol Or Through Serial Communications, So The Brain Runs On Linux, Organs And Suborgans Runs Everywhere, They Are All Connected To The Brain Wirelessly Or Wiredly</p>
